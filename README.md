This is a basic example of using React on the client and the server.

The React component is rendered on the server (Express) and the client side code then attaches event handlers to the existing elements on the page.

To run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:5000?name=Bob](http://localhost:5000?name=Bob)
